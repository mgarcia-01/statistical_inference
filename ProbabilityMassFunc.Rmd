## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

Interval Notation: Bracket means include. [0,20]. Round bracket means NOT include . (1, 10] means greater than 1 less than or equal to 10.
(a, b)	 	a < x < b	 	an open interval
[a, b)	 	a ≤ x < b	 	closed on left, open on right
(a, b]	 	a < x ≤ b	 	open on left, closed on right
[a, b]	 	a ≤ x ≤ b	 	a closed interval

Theta symbol = θ



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
